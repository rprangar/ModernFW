  @param[in] This                 Pointer to the PCH_SPI_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in] FlashRegionType      The Flash Region type for flash cycle which is listed in the Descriptor.
  @param[in] Address              The Flash Linear Address must fall within a region for which BIOS has access permissions.
  @param[in] ByteCount            Number of bytes in the data portion of the SPI cycle.
  @param[out] Buffer              The Pointer to caller-allocated buffer containing the dada received.
                                  It is the caller's responsibility to make sure Buffer is large enough for the total number of bytes read.
