/**
  This FSP API is used to notify the FSP about the different phases in the boot process.
  This allows the FSP to take appropriate actions as needed during different initialization
  phases. The phases will be platform dependent and will be documented with the FSP
  release. The current FSP supports following notify phases:
    Post PCI enumeration
    Ready To Boot
    End of firmware

  @param[in] Delta              The delta between the new and old base.
                                Delta = NewBase - OldBase

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The rebasing was handled successfully.
